  let p1 = <p>The year is 2671.</p>
  let p2 = <p>3 days ago, Earth Systems - Space Division picked up a strange signal coming from deep, uncharted space. The origin and intent of this beacon is unknown.</p>
  let p3 = <>
    <p>The ES-SD has assembled a small crew of top personnel to investigate this phenomenon.
      As part of the crew, you were given extremely short notice of this mission and rushed through the formal standard procedure for pre-deployment.
    </p>
    <p>During the briefing by the ES-SD big-wigs, you barely had time to meet the rest of the team. You were given the name of the ship - the Revolution By Night, the facts about the mission (of which there were almost none), and a timeline for the operation.</p>
  </>
  let p4 = <>
    <p>Then, as quickly as you knew of the mission, you were gone. Shot into the traverse.
      You’ve been off-world for 3 hours… you and the crew prepare for Cryo-Sleep, where you’ll be in stasis for 7 months while the ship’s artificial intelligence, RBN, auto-pilots the Revolution by Night to the signal’s approximate location.</p>
    <p>As you lay in your pod, trying desperately to fall asleep, all you can think about is what you’ll find on the other end of this journey…</p>
  </>

  let p5 = <>
    <p>*Your eyes slowly open…</p>
    <p>*As you come to, you realize you’re lying on the ground - just outside your pod, with a woman kneeling down right beside you.</p>
  </>
  let p6 = <p>Doctor: You awake? How do you feel?</p>
  let p7 = <p>*There’s others around. Walking, talking, getting dressed… They all look concerned. Like something isn’t right.</p>
  let p8 = <>
    <p>Yeah… I feel dizzy. And nauseous. Where am I? </p>
    <p>Doctor: You’re alright. You’re on the ESS Revolution By Night. Try not to panic. Do you know who I am?</p>
    <p>You: The Revolution By Night? No, no… who are you?</p>
  </>
  let p9 = <p>I’m the Doc for this flight. It’s okay, you’re gonna be okay. Your memory will come back to you soon, just gonna take some time. It’s a pretty normal reaction to such a long freeze; you’re the only one of us who wasn’t scheduled for a duty window.</p>
  let p10 = <>
    <p>You: I didn’t get a duty wake? How long was I zonked?</p>
    <p>Doctor: Over 7 months.</p>
    <p>You: ...Fuck.</p>
  </>
  let p11 = <>
    <p>*As the doc helps you up, you overhear the other crew members arguing… </p>
    <p>“Where the hell is he?”</p>
    <p>“When was his duty window?”</p>
    <p>“Who was up last?”</p>
    <p>“What the fuck is going on?”</p>
    <p>“Why is his pod closed?”</p>
    <p>“How the fu..”</p>
    <p>“EVERYBODY SHUT UP” a voice interrupts”</p>
  </>
  let p12 = <p>There’s a pause...</p>
  let p13 = <>
    <p>Security Officer: Everyone calm down. Get dressed. Get to the Main Deck ASAP. We need to talk.</p>
    <p>*Everyone looks at each other with shady eyes and moves to the deck.</p>
    <p>*Confused, you look to the doc</p>
    <p>You: What’s going on here?</p>
  </>
  let p14 = <p>Doctor: The Captain is missing. None of us know where he is… which makes no sense at all, I know. You good? Get dressed. We’ll figure it out on the deck.</p>
  let p15 = <>
    <p>*You shuffle to your locker. You find your suit and your glasses, as well as a book… with blood on it. It’s dry and has been there for a while. You contemplate where it came from.</p>
    <p>*Aboard the deck, everyone stands around the conference table. Scared and confused.</p>
  </>
  let p16 = <>
    <p>Navigator: Alright everyone. As I am second in command for this mission, I am now in charge of this ship and this operation. I want this ship turned around and flown home immediately. We have a missing crew member and absolutely no fucking sign of him. </p>
    <p>Pilot: Well I’m all about that skipper, but we’ve got a problem: Rubin’s auto-pilot program is still running and I can’t turn it off. I have no control over this ship.</p>
    <p>Navigator: What?</p>
  </>
  let p17 = <>
    <p>Botanist: Isn’t that supposed to end as soon as the Cryo-Cycle is up?</p>
    <p>Pilot: Yup.</p>
    <p>Navigator: Tech, I want you to talk to Rubin. Find out what’s going on and how to fix it. </p>
    <p>Technician: I’ll look into it. Shouldn’t be a problem. Probably just didn’t register the ping.</p>
    <p>Navigator: Alright, as soon as that AP program is down, I want you to turn this bird around.</p>
    <p>*The pilot shakes his head in agreeance</p>
  </>
  let p18 = <>
    <p>Engineer: Soo…. we’re still getting paid right?</p>
    <p>*Everyone looks at the Engineer with disgust.</p>
  </>
  let p19 = <>
    <p>Navigator: We have a missing man, our Captain no less, and you&apos;re concerned about your paycheck??</p>
    <p>Engineer: Look, I don’t know anyone here, I don’t know anything about whatever the hell we’re looking for, I don’t know where the Captain is, and I don’t know when we’re getting back. What I do know, is that we’re getting Space Pay for this bullshit and that’s all I care about.</p>
    <p>Navigator: Clearly.</p>
    <p>*The Engineer shrugs and plays it off.</p>
  </>
  let p20 = <>
    <p>Botanist: How the hell can he just disappear? That’s like a sailor disappearing from a submarine without surfacing.</p>
    <p>Physicist: We’ve looked everywhere. The lifeboat is still docked, his pod is empty, his stuff is still here, Rubin has no record of him thawing out and getting up, none of us have seen him since we got in the ice box, and there’s no fucking sign of him. Anywhere.</p>
    <p>Navigator: I know.</p>
  </>
  let p21 = <>
    <p>Physicist: So what the fuck do we do!?</p>
    <p>Cook: What the fuck CAN we do?</p>
    <p>*A light roar of arguing ensues, you watch. Dumbfounded and worried.</p>
  </>
  let p22 = <>
    <p>Navigator: LISTEN!</p>
    <p>*Everyone shuts up and looks at him.</p>
  </>
  let p23 = <>
    <p>Navigator: I know we’re all scared and confused. But I want everyone to calm down and report to their assigned place of duty immediately. This mission is over as soon as that AP program is down. I’m gonna find out what happened here, but I need everyone to cooperate and do their jobs. Hell, any one of us could be involved in whatever’s going on here. But I need you all to trust me.</p>
    <p>*Everyone stays silent, but has a nod of understanding.</p>
    <p>Navigator: Dismissed.</p>
  </>
  let p24 = <>
    <p>*The party breaks up. Everyone heads to their respective part of the Revolution. You stay behind and try to piece together whatever you can remember.</p>
    <p>Doctor: You okay?</p>
    <p>You: Yeah… just a weird situation to be in. Especially when I can’t remember any of these people and why we’re here.</p>
  </>
  let p25 = <>
    <p>Doctor: Yeah, no kidding. Well come see me at the lab later. I’ll give you another look-see.</p>
    <p>*You shake your head and she walks away.</p>
